/*******************
DOM Manipulation

Document Object Model: Structure representation of an HTML Document
DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript
For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with right from our JS code

JS vs DOM
js and dom are different things

querySelector lets us select stuff exactly how we would in css...it can also be used to read and store variables
but it only allows us to select the first item. 
becuase of type coercion, it will change the activeplayer to the ID element
the '<em>' adds italics to the word
innerHTML will change it to HTML where as innerText and textContent will display the <em> on the screen as well

Events are like notifications that are sent to notify our code that something happended on the webpage
examples of events are clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down, pressing a key
Events Listeners: a fucntio that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen
